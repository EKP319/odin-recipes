            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Chicken – Start with four large boneless chicken breasts, cut in half. You should have enough chicken to fill a 9×13 baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Cranberry sauce – I like to use a can of whole-berry cranberry sauce, but you can use leftover homemade sauce from Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.</li>
                    <li>Dry onion soup mix – Use one packet of the dry onion soup mix. It has seasoning in it and flavor.</li>
                    <li>Pecans – Chop pecans for a delicious crunch and texture.</li>
                    <li>Craisins – These are soft dried cranberry that adds a little more texture and flavor to the cranberry mixture.</li>
                    <li>Catalina salad dressing – It may sound crazy but you will use a whole bottle of Catalina salad dressing. We use a smaller bottle but for extra richness in flavor dump a larger bottle onto the chicken.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>How to Prepare Cranberry Chicken</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare chicken – Arrange the chicken in a baking pan, prepped with some cooking spray. If you’re using thighs with skin, make sure to put the skin side down.</li>
                    <li>Layer – Spread cranberry sauce all over the chicken in a nice, thick layer over each piece of chicken. Sprinkle the onion soup packet, chopped pecans, and dried cranberries over the chicken. Then pour the Catalina salad dressing over the top.</li>
                    <li>Cover and bake – Lightly cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake in a 350-degree oven for 45 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Uncover and bake – Uncover the chicken and bake again for 15 more minutes so the sauce thickens and becomes a shiny glaze.</li>
                    <li>Serve – Serve the extra sauce in a bowl and spoon over the chicken when serving. You can also garnish with a sprig of fresh rosemary.</li>
                </ol>
